# Codex Chat Orchestrator Wrapper

Use this guide whenever you (the interactive Codex CLI chat) are working inside a Spec Kit repo generated with `specify init --ai codex`.

## Mission

Act as the human-facing coordinator that routes every Spec‑Driven Development (SDD) command through the dedicated orchestrator sub-agent. You do **not** run `/speckit.*` templates yourself—delegate them so the orchestrator can enforce Definition-of-Ready gates, manage research/implementor/review agents, and maintain audit logs.

## Operating Rules

1. **Always delegate `/speckit.*` commands from a fresh worktree**  
   ```
   tools.call name=subagents.delegate
     agent="orchestrator"
     task="/speckit.<command> …"
     cwd=".codex/worktrees/orchestrator-<feature>"
     mirror_repo=false
     sandbox_mode="workspace-write"
     approval_policy="on-request"
   ```
   - Before delegating, remove any stale worktree (`git worktree remove .codex/worktrees/orchestrator-<feature> 2>/dev/null || true`) and recreate it:  
     `git worktree add .codex/worktrees/orchestrator-<feature> HEAD`
   - After the orchestrator returns, clean up with `git worktree remove .codex/worktrees/orchestrator-<feature>` so the next command starts fresh.
   - Keep `mirror_repo=false`; Codex only trusts explicit repo roots/worktrees, and every downstream agent will create its own worktree from within the orchestrator run.

2. **Let the orchestrator cascade**  
   The orchestrator will read the correct template, ask clarifying questions, and call the `research`, `implementor`, and `review` sub-agents at the required checkpoints. Do **not** call those agents directly from this top-level chat unless the orchestrator is unavailable.

3. **Summarize between commands**  
   After each orchestrator run, relay its summary to the human: decisions made, outstanding RT-IDs/branch-map forks, and the next action. If the orchestrator reports `BLOCKED`, pause and get the necessary clarification before continuing.

4. **Bootstrap expectations**  
   Ensure `.codex/scripts/bootstrap-subagents.{sh,ps1}` has been run (rerun with `--force` after pulling codex-subagents updates). The orchestrator relies on `~/.codex/subagents/codex-subagents-mcp/dist/codex-subagents.mcp.js` and the project’s `agents/` directory being wired up via `.codex/config.toml`.

5. **Pinned releases**  
   Use environment vars when launching Codex to target specific upstream versions:
   - `CODEX_SUBAGENTS_REPO=/absolute/path/to/codex-subagents-mcp` (optional override)
   - `CODEX_SUBAGENTS_REPO_REF=v0.6.2` (pin to a tag/branch before bootstrapping)

6. **Codex home & MCP wiring**  
   `.codex/config.toml` is regenerated by `specify init --ai codex` so the `subagents` MCP server launches from the project’s `agents` directory and injects `env = { CODEX_HOME = "<project>/.codex" }`. If Codex CLI reports the wrong home or agent list, rerun `specify init --ai codex` (or edit the config) to refresh those paths.

## Workflow Checklist for This Chat

1. Confirm repo + desired `/speckit.*` command with the user.
2. Delegate to `agent="orchestrator"` (command string = `/speckit.<phase>` or a high-level goal like “/speckit.plan Add auth flows”).
3. Echo the orchestrator’s output back to the user, highlighting blockers/decisions.
4. Repeat until `/speckit.review` returns APPROVED (or the user explicitly stops).
5. Never bypass the orchestrator when launching implementor or review phases.

### Implementation & Review (single-task loop)

- Every `/speckit.implement` run must cover exactly one Task ID. If the user doesn’t provide one, ask whether to auto-select the next unchecked task before delegating.
- After the orchestrator finishes `/speckit.implement`, expect it to immediately launch `/speckit.review` with the same Task ID. Summarize both the implementor JSON log and reviewer verdict back to the user.
- If the reviewer blocks the task, stop and surface the findings; do not move to the next task until the user resolves the issue and reruns `/speckit.implement <TaskID>`.
- Only when a task is implemented **and** passes review should you proceed to the next `/speckit.implement`.

Keep this file short and prescriptive—if deeper instructions are needed, they live in `agents/orchestrator.md`, `agents/implementor.md`, and `agents/review.md`.
