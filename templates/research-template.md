# Research: [FEATURE]

**Date**: [DATE]  
**Owner**: [NAME]

## Objectives

- Resolve assumptions from spec.md (see Assumptions section)
- Inform plan decisions with fresh, cited evidence
- Validate product decisions with domain/market data

## Design Reference Gallery (8–15 examples)

Initial anchors for tone/quality: Linear, Stripe, Figma (variation allowed).

| # | Product | URL | What to emulate | Screenshot/Notes |

## Freshness & Source Quality

- [ ] All citations ≤ 6 months old, or justified if older
- [ ] Primary sources (docs, maintainers, reputable blogs) preferred
- [ ] Conflicting sources resolved or noted

## Closure

- [ ] All Assumptions from spec.md resolved
- [ ] Open risks documented with follow-up tasks
